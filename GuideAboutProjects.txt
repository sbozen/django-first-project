Catalog is our project. We started use with django-admin startproject ProjectName.If u want use some apps(etc. pages) u have to install with manage.py 
    py manage.py startapp pages
Then, We config urls settings. If u want use pages, u add settings parameters under. For instance like as, 

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'pages.apps.PagesConfig', ...]

This command block is say,
    def index(request):
    return render(request, 'pages/index.html')
u send request to pages/index.html. Thus(Böylece) we can define what we should

And then u should import lib like as at here,

    from django.urls import path"
    from . import views"

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.index, name='index'),
        path('about', views.about, name='about'),
    ]
These are means 127.0.0.1/ -> Index Pages, 127.0.0.1/about -> About Pages
U should be carefully due to define root path. Because we don't define another parameters in root. Also, this define in subjacent main folder into urls.py
    path('', include('pages.urls'))
    # If add params into nails, your pages will look like as  127.0.0.1/pages
So, ıf we would add params, we should write  127.0.0.1/pages/about on browser


# Documentation for static-files https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/static-files/
If u use external static folders in project, You add this line in INSTALLED_APPS
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
Then, you define /static/ for STATIC_URL. Settings seems good. Now, we create static folder in project. That's great. Anymore we can use static files in project. How can we use? Basically like as this,
    Add {% load static %} top on pages
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/style.css' %}">
