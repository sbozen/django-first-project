First let's define creating the django project
            DJANGO notes
Firstly, u should create virtual enviroment. This is important due to install library in project. Thus, we'll install on only project 
py -m venv envProjectName
 .\myproject\Scripts\activate
pip install django

 pip freeze -> This is check load packet,libs in your project

Then, these are need things for start 
py -m django-admin startproject projectName
(Don't worry! If u don't remember how was start, u have to write django-admin help. U find all commands for project)
Finally, you create Django project, yey!
If u write this command line 
   py manage.py runserver 
You can see on browser. 

Finally, Let's start.

Catalog is our project. We started use with django-admin startproject ProjectName.If u want use some apps(etc. pages) u have to install with manage.py 
    py manage.py startapp pages
Then, We config urls settings. If u want use pages, u add settings parameters under. For instance like as, 

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'pages.apps.PagesConfig', ...]

This command block is say,
    def index(request):
    return render(request, 'pages/index.html')
u send request to pages/index.html. Thus(Böylece) we can define what we should

And then u should import lib like as at here,

    from django.urls import path"
    from . import views"

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.index, name='index'),
        path('about', views.about, name='about'),
    ]
These are means 127.0.0.1/ -> Index Pages, 127.0.0.1/about -> About Pages
U should be carefully due to define root path. Because we don't define another parameters in root. Also, this define in subjacent main folder into urls.py
    path('', include('pages.urls'))
    # If add params into nails, your pages will look like as  127.0.0.1/pages
So, ıf we would add params, we should write  127.0.0.1/pages/about on browser


# Documentation for static-files https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/static-files/

If u use external static folders in project, You add this line in INSTALLED_APPS
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
Then, you define /static/ for STATIC_URL. Settings seems good. Now, we create static folder in project. That's great. Anymore we can use static files in project. How can we use? Basically like as this,
    Add {% load static %} top on pages
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/style.css' %}">
If u have sticky bars on project, you can use this way, 
    {% include 'partials/_navbar.html' %}

If u want add more apps in project, this command solve your request.(We can simulate create components.) 
     py manage.py startapp movies
And we introduce in urls.py againly. If we can come db operations,
Firstly, 
    py manage.py migrate
This command create db responsibilty and set settings. We can use different database. But django is come default sqlLite. You can look django documantaion for installation another database.
Now, we need superuser at the project. What should we do?
    py manage.py createsuperuser
Thus, you can sign admin panel with use this user information

We'll create new table in project. Enter the models.py under the movies folder.
And, add commands according to our wishes (we need look documantaion for describe create)
    class Movie(models.Model):
    #wishes
    name: models.CharField(max_length=100)  # Input text
    description = models.TextField()
    image = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    created_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

Then we need migrate for create table on admin panel. Migrate is like as columns move to admin.Create migrate after describe in models with this command. 
    py manage.py makemigrations
This will give output file
